## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was made to be a full stack application including front-end, back-end and mobile.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Container Platform
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) - Package Manager

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

### Cloning Repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gregorispielmann/gobarber.git
```

### Containers

First of all you need to create the containers (Postgres and redis), after install docker run the following command on your terminal

**IMPORTANT! Replace ???? by an available port**

```
$ docker run --name gobarber -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -p ????:5432 -d postgres:11
To create the container for Postgres DB

And then

$ docker run --name redisgobarber -p ????:6379 -d -t redis:alpine
To create the container to Redis

```

### Database

Before run backend you will need create the postgres database in our container. For this I highly recommend you to use [Postbird](https://github.com/Paxa/postbird). Then connect with your information (Postgres container) and create the database with name **'gobarber'** before you go to next step.

### Backend

After create and run all containers, create the postgres database you will be ready to initialize the backend.

Inside the backend folder run commands below.

```
$ yarn
To install all dependencies

$ yarn sequelize db:migrate
To run all migrations to database

$ yarn sequelize db:seed:all
To seed database with fake data
```

**ATTENTION! Before you start the development mode of backend, you will need edit the .envexample to your information and rename the file to .env**

After this you only need to run command below

```
$ yarn dev
This will start backend in dev mode

$ yarn queue
This will start the redis task queue
```
